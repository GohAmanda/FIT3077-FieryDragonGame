## Getting Started
## FIT3077 Sprint4_MA_Tuesday08am_Team002 Folder

Welcome to the Fiery Dragon game. Here is a guideline to help you get started to run the executable file.

##Instruction how to create executabl form source code
1. First, open Visual Studio.
2. Open the project folder on Visual Studio.
3. At the bottom left corner, we can find the “JAVA PROJECTS” where we can find the symbol saying “EXPORT JAR”, click this symbol.
4. Then, we should select the main class of our project. In my case, App.java is the main class.
5. Finally, the jar file is created.

##how to run executable file
1)      Download the zip file and unzip it.
2)      Then, inside the extract folder, there is a jar file.
3)      After that, go to the command prompt, use “cd {path}” to change directory to the folder where the .jar in. The path is the lead to the folder where the  .jar file located. Copy the path( exclude the jar file name) . After changing directory to the location where the “.jar” is located in the command prompt. Use the command “java -jar {jarFileName}.jar to run and open the .jar file.
4)      After the program is opened, the main interface of the program is displayed.

5)  Aside from that, there are some requirements need to follow to ensure the program can run on your machine:
   	Operating system: only run for Windows version 10 (64-bit) and above
 	RAM (Memory) : 8 GB and above
  	Processor: Intel Core i5   	Storage: 512 GB
  	Platforms runnable: Visual Studio Code
   	JDK/java version: 1.8.0_381 and above, better use the latest version

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:
- `s4`: the folder contains all sprint 4 related files
- `bin`: the folder contains binary file of all classes
- `src/main/java`: the folder contains all source code of the game
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `Report`: the folder contains contributor analytics, Quality Model, Sprint 2 tech-based prototypes review, Conclusion for Sprint 2 tech-based prototypes,CRC cards, Class diagram, Executable descriptions
- `Pictures`: the folder contains all pictures used in the application
- `Project`: the folder that contains all documents submitted in Sprint 1

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.




> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
